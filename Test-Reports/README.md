# Innomatics Advanced GenAI Internship — Entrance Test (Analysis)

This workspace contains the analysis notebook and data files for the Innomatics Advanced GenAI internship entrance test.

Files

- `Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with data import, analysis, and answers.
- `orders.csv` — Orders data used for the analysis.
- `users.json` — User metadata (city, membership, etc.).
- `restaurants.sql` — Restaurant metadata (cuisine, rating) in SQL INSERT format.

Dependencies

- Python 3.8+ recommended
- pandas

Install dependencies (if needed):

```powershell
python -m pip install pandas
```

How to run

1. Open `Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab / VS Code Notebook.
2. Make sure the working directory is the project folder (where `orders.csv`, `users.json`, and `restaurants.sql` reside).
3. Run cells top-to-bottom (there are cells that load the data, compute metrics, and print results).

Notes

- The notebook already contains cells that compute the answers for the test questions (revenue by quarter, Gold/Regular analyses, counts, etc.).
- If you add or reorder cells, re-run the necessary ones to ensure variables are available in the kernel.
